    "\n",
    "I produced this notebook as a repository for my own understanding and plan to add to it as I learn more. I hope it might serve a similarly useful pedagogic purpose to others at the beginning of thier Python journey, and that those with greater expertise might correct any errors or misapprehensions they notice to help create a useful set of references that future us will be happy to have.\n",
    "\n",
    "Much of the fundamentals of this knowledge are based on Shashank's video \"Python for Data Scientists and Data Analysts\"; I strongly encourage you to support him in any way you can and make use of the explanations, documents, and courses he produces. I have found them to be excellent resources and trust that anyone wanting to brush up on their knowledge or learn the basics will as well.\n",
